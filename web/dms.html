            <h4 class="subtitle is-6 pastel-blue terminal mx-3">The tldr is always; don't spam me, don't have a fit if I don't respond, and respect if I block you.<br>
            I *will* block you if you keep testing limits, or are just flat out not acknowledging this. No exceptions.<br>
            I am a busy person, and I also sleep a lot. I can reassure you 1-4 dms is better than 10-20. Unless it is life-threateningly urgent (me ignoring you is not that.), I will get round to you.
            However, I will just mark as read any dms that go over 5 in a short period.<br>
            Furthermore, if you start complaining that I'm not responding... I'll just not respond further. I can reassure you I have better things to do than listen to people complain.
            If I'm not responding it's highly unlikely to be on purpose, it's more than likely because I'm busy or I'm procrasinating.<br>
