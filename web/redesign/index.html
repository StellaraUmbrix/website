                        Hi! I'm Robyn-Dawn, a passionate computer scientist from Lincolnshire, UK, who loves exploring unique hobbies alongside my studies. My interests include Emergency Alert System (EAS) scenarios, analogue horror, and fire alarms, 
                        and I enjoy using my programming skills to create simulations of these scenarios. Recently, I have also been learning video editing to bring more life to my simulations and make them even more immersive. My attention to detail 
                        and creativity have helped me create realistic and engaging simulations that stand out from the crowd.<br>

                        While my hobbies might seem unusual, they reflect my broader interests in computer science and my eagerness to explore new and exciting areas of the field. I'm highly focused and dedicated to my studies, and I am eager to pursue a 
                        degree in computer science at the University of Essex to further my knowledge and skills. I believe that my unique hobbies and interests give me a unique perspective on the field and enable me to bring fresh ideas and approaches to 
                        the table.

                        The World's Break is a personal EAS scenario channel that I started in March 2022. While it may not have a large following or an active community, I am proud of the channel and the content that I have created for it. As a passionate EAS
                        scenario creator, I wanted to have a space where I could share my work and engage with others who share my interests. The channel features a variety of simulated emergency scenarios, including weather alerts, amber alerts, and civil 
                        emergency messages, as well as custom-designed alerts that reflect my unique interests and creative vision.<br><br>

                        Despite its smaller audience, The World's Break has provided me with a valuable platform for sharing my work and receiving feedback from those who appreciate my creativity and attention to detail. I believe that this feedback has 
                        helped me improve my skills and create even more engaging and realistic EAS scenarios. I am committed to continuing to create and share my EAS simulations with others through The World's Break, even if it remains a smaller, personal 
                        channel.
