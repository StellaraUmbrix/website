                Hi there! My name is Robyn-Dawn, and I'm a computer scientist, fullstack and electrical engineer, traveler, punk rock
                enthusiast, space enthusiast, and queer content creator. I use he/they pronouns, and I have an androgynous
                presentation.<br><br>

                I was born on May 11th, and I grew up in a small rural village in Lincolnshire, England. Growing up, I was always interested
                in technology and enjoyed tinkering with gadgets and electronics in my spare time. In high school, I became drawn to
                media studies and photography, which fueled my passion for storytelling and creative expression. Although these subjects
                didn't end up being my career path, they've been valuable tools for me as a writer and video editor.<br><br>

                I used to study computer science, however I heavily burnt out from it, and gave it up. Now, I mostly focus on being a
                full stack engineer. In addition to my work in tech, I'm also passionate about writing and storytelling. I'm a big fan of 
                the SCP Foundation and Emergency Alert System (EAS), which has inspired me to create my own stories and content around these 
                themes. I'm also a fire alarm enthusiast, and I love learning about different types of alarms and their uses.<br><br>

                Outside of my professional interests, I'm a member of the furry community. I've been a furry since 2018, and it's been a
                wonderful way for me to connect with like-minded people and express myself creatively.<br><br>

                As a traveler, I enjoy exploring new places and immersing myself in different cultures. I've been fortunate enough to
                visit several countries across Europe, Africa, and North America, and I'm always eager to discover new destinations. I'm
                particularly drawn to countries with rich histories, beautiful landscapes, and vibrant punk rock scenes. While
                traveling, I enjoy trying local foods, meeting new people, and taking in the sights and sounds of my
                surroundings.<br><br>

                In addition to being a punk rock enthusiast, I'm also a space enthusiast. I'm fascinated by the mysteries of the
                universe and the potential for space exploration to lead to new discoveries and advancements in technology. I love
                staying up-to-date on the latest space news and developments, and I hope to one day contribute to the field
                myself.<br><br>

                Recently, I've also started learning German as a second language. It's been challenging but rewarding, and I hope to use
                my language skills to connect with more people from different parts of the world.<br><br>

                Looking ahead, I'm planning to move to Brighton or potentially abroad in the upcoming years. I'm excited to explore new
                places and meet new people, and I know that my skills and experience will serve me well no matter where I go. Whether
                it's working on exciting tech projects, creating new stories and content, exploring new cultures, or contributing to the
                field of space exploration, I'm constantly looking for new opportunities to learn and grow.<br><br>

                Thanks for taking the time to learn more about me! If you have any questions or want to chat, feel free to reach out.
