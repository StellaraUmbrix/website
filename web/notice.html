                            <h3 class="is-3 gradient-text terminal">
                                I am aware I have been absent as of late. And honestly? I have an explanation. <br>
                                Ever since Discord announced their new Terms of Service, alongside the new "themed client" Nitro feature, I am very concerned for my privacy and the future of Discord. <br>
                                I have been using Discord for a long time, and I have made many friends on there. But I am not willing to give up my privacy for a chat client, and I refuse to pay for a feature that is free if you download BetterDiscord. <br>
                                Personally, I believe 2023 is the start of the end for Discord. They have followed the path of most corporations in focusing on their wallet. If you've known me for a while, you know that normally I do not give two sides
                                of a monkey's arse about corporational greed and privacy. However, with Discord, a company that is already on thin ice with the community due to their NFT stunt, I believe I have a right to be concerned. <br>
                                Now, I want to say, I am not leaving Discord. My account will remain. However, <strong>please do not use it as a main source to communicate unless you know me in person.</strong> I use it to moderate Frostbyte's Discord server,
                                and my personal F/F server (if you are not already in, please ask me for an invite). I am now in the process of migrating to Telegram, and furthermore Mastodon, as I believe they are are currently the best solutions for the
                                Discord / Twitter privacy issue. If you have not already, please contact me for my Telegram username, or join my Telegram group <a href="https://t.me/robyninspace">here</a>. <br>
                                <br>
                                Second of all, I wish to say that I will remain as lead for FrostbyteSpace. I will continue to work on projects and maintain the website under the team name. However, I will no longer primarily be available on the Discord
                                server. However, I will not be as active on development as I have been in the past. I have currently started a few projects (which I am under NDA for), and I will be working on them in my free time instead of Frostbyte and 
                                projects under the FrostbyteSpace name. <br>
                                <br>
                                I would personally like to thank everyone who has supported me over the years on Discord. I have made many friends for life on there, and they are the only reason I am not dead in a ditch in Cambridgeshire. I want to personally
                                say these people are: <br><br>
                                Cipher, Anthony, Tyrasuki, Xiknu, Luna, Leaf, Zincy, and a few more who wish to remain anonymous. <br><br>
                                From the bottom of my heart, I thank you all for being there for me. <br>
                                Now that I have said my piece, in the words of the great philosopher, <strong>Shrek</strong>: <br>
                                <br>
                                <i>"It's not ogre, it's ogre."</i>
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                Now, before this sounds like a suicide note, I wish to say, I will always be reachable by email, Telegram, or Mastodon. And if you read this and you don't know who I am or you don't follow me on Discord... 
                                Hi :3
                                <br>

                                <br>
                                <br>

                                P.S: If you want this in German... Use translate. I am falling behind massively on my German.
