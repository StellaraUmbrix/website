                Now look, I know most people by now expected me to switch back to the Microsoft ecosystem and it "was just a phase" blah blah blah.
                Well sad to say, but you're wrong. I'm still daily driving Arch Linux, and I am still migrating towards the Steam Deck.<br><br>

                Now after last month's post, I did have a few more problems. I accidentally installed Plasma's KDE alongside GNOME on my main system,
                which I did not use at all. And silly me, I didn't realise when installing that NetworkManager was a dependency of Plasma, meaning
                Pacman (Arch's package manager) would uninstall NetworkManager. This is so far the only time I have had to use arch-chroot. But I highly doubt this will be my last.
                Another issue I am actively facing is mdadm not assembling my RAID0 array on boot (for a daily system snapshot) - which I am still yet
                to fix due to the fact that the Arch wiki has led me in circles. If anyone has any ideas, please let me know.<br><br>

                Now, I am still in the process of migrating away from my Series S. Now, I'm sure some of you think that this is hesitation or that I'm
                "not really doing it". However, it is solely due to finances. Turns out, repurchasing all your games on Steam is not cheap,
                especially on a student budget. And well, with 50 games on my Steam wishlist - it won't be done any time soon.<br><br>

                I also now installed Arch on my laptop, overwriting Manjaro, and there is not much different there. Since Manjaro is already Arch-
                based, the only difference is the lack of Manjaro's branding and software. I do have to admit though, Manjaro's ability to install
                from the AUR (Arch User Repository) was definetly a creature comfort I miss. But, I can live without it.<br><br>

                Now of course, I'm sure some of you are wondering "Is gaming even that good on Linux?", and well, it's got its ups and downs.
                For example, Stellaris is very broken on Linux, and even worse through Proton. However, I hope PDX will fix this soon
                as I am a massive fan of their games. However, on the other hand, I have found that games like Minecraft run
                much better on Linux than Windows, and I have found that I have been playing it more often since the switch.<br><br>
